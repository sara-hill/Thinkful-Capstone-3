This was my final capstone for the Thinkful Data Analystics Immersive Bootcamp. 

This capstone provides an in depth analysis of Video Game Sales Data from a data set that was found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/holmjason2/videogamedata

Overview: 

This data set contains content for over 13,000 video games, ranging from the years 1977 to the middle of 2020. Most of the data seemed to have come directly from the VGChartz database, which showcases critic scores and user scores, as well as how many copies of those games were sold. A lot of the critic and user scores were entered manually from MetaCritic.

Goals of this analysis:

Are video games actually getting worse throughout the years or are they getting better?

Do user ratings/critic ratings affect what game is bought/sold by various video game companies?
